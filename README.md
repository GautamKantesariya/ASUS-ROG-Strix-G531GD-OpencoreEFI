## üíæ How to flash USB drive

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This method is working for me. If it is not working for you then you can also follow the official [OpenCore](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/prerequisites.html) process. This methos is suitable for windows users only.

- first of all download the `macOS Ventura` image file in `.raw` or `.dmg` file format from `Hackintosh community shop` or from wherever you want.

- Then after insert your USB drive and open [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). Now select the USB drive and flash the `macOS Ventura` file which is downloaded earlier.

- After that, open [MiniTool Partition Wizard](https://www.partitionwizard.com/free-partition-manager.html) and find the EFI partition of the USB drive which you flash earlier.

- Then right-click on the EFI partition and select assign letter. Next, assign any letter to the selected partition and click on apply button. Now you can see the EFI partition of the USB drive in `My Computer` but can not open that partition.

- Now open [Explorer++](https://explorerplusplus.com/download) as Run as an administrator. After that, go to the EFI partition of the USB drive and delete the EFI folder.

- Now download my EFI folder and [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS). After that, open [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) folder then run the `GenSMBIOS.bat` file and enter the number accordingly where the `Generate SMBIOS` option is given.<br/><br/>

- Then after download [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) and open folder and run `ProperTree.command` file. Then click on the file then click on open. After that navigate to the EFI folder which you download from this repository and then go to the `EFI > OC > config.plist` and open it.<br/>

- Then after replacing existing fields with new fields which you generated earlier through GenSMBIOS.<br/><br/>

- Double-click on the values fields which are highlighted and replace them with the given table.

| Existing Field Name | Replace with |                        
| -------- | ------------ |
| MLB| Board Serial |
| SystemSerialNumber| Serial |
| SystemUUID | SmUUID |

for example, we want to change the MLB value in `config.plist` then double click on the value field of MLB and delete it now copy the Board Serial value from another GenSMBIOS terminal and paste it in the MLB value field. Replace all 3 values with new values.

- Then after saving the file and close all windows.

- Now copy the EFI folder and open Explorer++ with Run as administrator and navigate to the EFI partition and paste the EFI folder.

- At this stage, you have ready to install a USB drive for mac installation. Change your BIOS settings respectively (Self-research requires ü§ì).  

- Make a 100GB partition and boot it into a USB drive and install macOS. watch the YouTube video for the installation process.

- Note: Changing PlatformInfo is very important otherwise iCloud services will not work.
